# Sports Stats
Sports Stats creates player ranking tables based of a Z-score rating system in a variety of professional sports leagues including the NBA, NFL and NHL. The overall Z-score of each player is calculated by comparing their performance to other players in each statistical category chosen by the user. The Z-score for each category is then added to the overall rating and the final overall-score rating is to create the ranking table. This project can be used for applications such as fantasy sports.

## Description

- Football: *Work in progress*
